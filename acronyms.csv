Effective date,This is sometimes used in reference to the date AMA is fully implemented (Feb 14, 2019), OR the date that a Veteran's benefits are payable - the effective date is assigned when the VA decides to grant a Veteran benefits (I'm not sure how the effective date is decided, but I think it depends on the actual circumstances of the claim, and the type of benefit being awarded),VA Appeals,
Effectuation,A Veteran's benefits have been updated to reflect what was written in a VA decision. Sometimes referred to as "adjustment.",VA Appeals,
End Product Last Action Date,After an End Product gets cleared, we save the End Product's last_action_date on any Decision Issues that are created as a result. We use this as a proxy for decision date for non-rating issues that were processed in VBMS because they don't have a rating profile date, and we do not have access to the exact decision date.,VA Appeals,

Profile Date,The Profile Date on a rating represents the date that the issues on the Rating were decided.  We use this as as the Decision Date for previous Ratings and Decision Issues. We use this on the user interface for Claim Assistants to match issues submitted by Veterans with previous ratings. We also use this as an identifier for a Rating for a given Veteran.,VA Appeals,
Promulgation Date,After a Rating has been decided and there is an award there is an additional step when the award gets legally finalized which is called promulgation. We use this date to determine whether a Rating is within the eligible window of time to be appealed.,VA Appeals,

Rating Issue,The issue (see above) as recorded in VBMS. This issue represents the Board's response to a claim.,VA Appeals,
Receipt Date,The Receipt Date for an Intake indicates the date it was received by central mail processing.  This date is used to determine which Ratings are eligible to be selected, Ratings with promulgation dates in future of the Receipt Date will not appear as options, and Ratings further in the past than the eligible period (if applicable) will be considered untimely unless they have an exemption.,VA Appeals,
Request Issue,The issue (see above) as recorded in Caseflow. This issue represents the Veteran's response to a Rating Issue. Each Request Issue is represented by a Contention on the VBMS side. The Intake process is the act of creating End Products (Contentions) tracked by Request Issues in response to Rating Issues. A new Rating Issue will eventually be created by the Board on the VBMS side in response to each Request Issue. This is the circle of life: Rating Issue -> Request Issue -> Rating Issue. We cache those Contention responses in the `rating_issues` table.,VA Appeals,
